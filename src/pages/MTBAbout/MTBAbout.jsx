              "I loved my session with coach Sally! I've been mountain biking for about 6-7 years now and I was still nervous going in especially considering the laundry list of things I wanted to work on. Sally's instruction was great, she broke things down very well and helped me visualize what I need to do with my body position - she helped me do my first wheelie ever!"</h2>

            <p className='rightTextAboutContinuedRegular'>We were founded by Sally Collins. Sally regularly transforms herself from a diminutive uptown hairdresser to a single track-shredding she-beast ripping through local mountain-bike trails all in the same day.</p>

            <p className='rightTextAboutContinuedRegular'>She spends her free time with her two Aussie rescue dogs, Charley Cheyenne and Sadie Cheyanne. They brighten her life, especially when they run the trails with her!</p>

            <p className='rightTextAboutContinuedSmall'>Sally is the owner and artistic director of Sundance SalonSpa, an award-winning Aveda Concept Salon, in the quaint village of Zionsville, Indiana. Her love for making people feel beautiful from the inside out started more than 30 years ago, when she first became a hairdresser. In 1994, she married Pete Collins, and in 1997, they opened Sundance SalonSpa. Four short years later in 2001, Sally lost Pete to Leukemia. It was her reconnection with the bicycle that kept her moving forward.</p>
